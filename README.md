<h1>Examine NAT on a Wireless Router</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This GitHub repository documents the completion of a Cisco Networking Lab focused on exploring Network Address Translation (NAT) within a wireless router setup. The lab tasks involved configuring NAT, connecting PCs to the router via DHCP, and analyzing network traffic behavior. Through step-by-step instructions, I gained insights into NAT's impact on internal and external network communication, and I observed packet headers to understand NAT's address translation effects.
